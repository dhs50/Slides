# CS50 @ DHS - Slides
### What are these?
These are just a bunch of slides that I will present during each meeting
### Credits
Harvard and CS50. The original slides were modified to suit DHS. Also to remove Harvard related announcements, and add/remove bits of material.
### Organization
Folders here correspond to weeks in CS50. The week0 folder is for week0
Inside, there are 2 presentations. The one with a '1' as a postfix is for the first lecture. Same applies for '2'
### Help?
Talk to me later. Or email me
